# ffmpeg-video-on-image-overlay-gui

This app, made with Python and Tkinter, helps you put a video on top of a image.
It has easy-to-use tools to crop the video before adding it to the image. You
can choose how much to trim and where to place the video right from the app.

It's great for making your own video presentations or spicing up pictures with
moving videos.
